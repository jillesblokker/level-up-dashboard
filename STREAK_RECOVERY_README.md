# Streak Recovery Features Setup

## Quick Fix for Current Errors

The 500 errors you're seeing on your tasks page have been **fixed** with backward compatibility. Your app should work normally now, but you won't see the new recovery features until you run the database migration below.

## Database Migration Required

To enable the new streak recovery features, you need to add new columns to your `streaks` table.

### Step 1: Run the Migration

1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `migrate-streak-recovery.sql`
4. Click **Run**

### Step 2: Verify Migration

After running the migration, you should see:
- âœ… Confirmation message: "Streak recovery migration completed successfully! ðŸŽ‰"
- âœ… List of new columns added to the streaks table

### Step 3: Enjoy Recovery Features

Once migrated, visit the **Recovery** tab in your tasks page to access:

- **Safety Net**: First missed day in 7 doesn't break your streak
- **Comeback Challenges**: Easier tasks to rebuild momentum after breaks  
- **Streak Reconstruction**: Spend build tokens to restore broken streaks
- **Resilience Points**: Earned every 7 days for completing weeks

## What's New

### Safety Net System
- Automatically protects your first missed day each week
- No more losing 30-day streaks due to one bad day
- Resets every Monday

### Comeback Challenges  
- Easier versions of regular exercises
- Appear when you need to rebuild momentum
- Designed for success to restore confidence

### Streak Reconstruction
- Spend 5 build tokens to restore a broken streak
- Restores to your previous maximum achievement

### Resilience Points

## Migration File

The migration is safe and includes:
- `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses to prevent errors
- Default values for all new columns
- Performance indexes
- Verification queries

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the Supabase logs for errors
2. Verify you have proper permissions on the `streaks` table
3. The app will work without migration (just without recovery features)
