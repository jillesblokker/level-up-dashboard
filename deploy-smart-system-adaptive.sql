-- ==========================================
-- DEPLOY SMART QUEST COMPLETION SYSTEM (ADAPTIVE)
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor
-- This version checks your table structure first and adapts to it
-- ==========================================

-- 1. First, let's see what columns actually exist in your table
DO $$ 
BEGIN
    RAISE NOTICE 'üîç Checking quest_completion table structure...';
END $$;

-- Check what columns exist in your quest_completion table
SELECT 
    column_name,
    data_type,
    is_nullable,
    column_default
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'quest_completion' 
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- 2. Check current data status
DO $$ 
BEGIN
    RAISE NOTICE 'üìä Current quest_completion table data status:';
END $$;

SELECT 
    'Current Status' as info,
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE completed = true) as completed_records,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE completed = false) as false_records
FROM quest_completion;

-- 3. CLEAN UP EXISTING DATA (Adaptive to your table structure)
DO $$ 
BEGIN
    RAISE NOTICE 'üßπ Cleaning up existing invalid quest completion records...';
END $$;

-- Remove records where completed = false but have completion data (these are invalid)
DELETE FROM quest_completion 
WHERE completed = false 
    AND (completed_at IS NOT NULL OR xp_earned > 0 OR gold_earned > 0);

-- Remove records where completed = false but have timestamps (these are invalid)
DELETE FROM quest_completion 
WHERE completed = false 
    AND completed_at IS NOT NULL;

-- Fix records where completed = true but missing required data
-- Based on your actual table structure: completed_at has default now(), xp_earned/gold_earned are nullable
UPDATE quest_completion 
SET 
    xp_earned = CASE WHEN xp_earned IS NULL OR xp_earned = 0 THEN 50 ELSE xp_earned END,
    gold_earned = CASE WHEN gold_earned IS NULL OR gold_earned = 0 THEN 25 ELSE gold_earned END
WHERE completed = true 
    AND (xp_earned IS NULL OR xp_earned = 0 OR gold_earned IS NULL OR gold_earned = 0);

-- 4. Now add the CHECK constraint (should work after cleanup)
DO $$ 
BEGIN
    RAISE NOTICE 'üîí Adding smart completion logic constraint...';
    
    -- Add constraint to prevent completed: false with completion data
    IF NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.table_constraints 
        WHERE constraint_name = 'chk_quest_completion_logic'

            (completed = false AND xp_earned = 0 AND gold_earned = 0)
            OR 
            -- If completed = true, then completion data should exist
            (completed = true AND xp_earned > 0 AND gold_earned > 0)
        );
        RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ Added smart completion logic constraint';
