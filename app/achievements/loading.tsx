          In the shadowed halls of Necrion&apos;s keep,<br/>
          Where ancient treasures lie in slumber deep,<br/>
          A seeker of glory and renown,<br/>
          Searches for achievements to call their own.<br/>
          <br/>
          Through trials of might and tests of will,<br/>
          They climb the ladder, higher still,<br/>
          Each milestone reached, a story to tell,<br/>
          Of perseverance and triumph as well.<br/>
          <br/>
          So let us search these hallowed grounds,<br/>
          Where legends and achievements can be found,<br/>
          For every step forward, no matter how small,<br/>
          Brings us closer to achieving it all.
