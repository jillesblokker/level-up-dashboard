          In the shadowed halls of Necrion’s keep,<br/>
          The evil king brooded, his secrets deep.<br/>
          With a heart of stone and a crown of dread,<br/>
          He hoarded treasures, gold and ruby red.<br/>
          Knights vanished seeking his fabled prize,<br/>
          Whispers of curses and spectral cries.<br/>
          Yet in the gloom, a glimmer of hope grew—<br/>
          For every lock, a hero breaks through.<br/>
          Will you uncover what Necrion concealed?<br/>
          Or join the legends, forever sealed?
