Create a SQL script for a quest favorites system in Supabase. I need a `quest_favorites` table with:

- UUID primary key with auto-generation
- user_id (TEXT for Clerk authentication)
- quest_id (TEXT)
- favorited_at timestamp
- created_at/updated_at timestamps
- Unique constraint on (user_id, quest_id)

Enable Row Level Security with policy: users can only access their own favorites using auth.uid().

Add indexes on user_id and quest_id for performance.

Include proper permissions for authenticated users.

The table will be used for API operations: GET (fetch user's favorites), POST (add favorite), DELETE (remove favorite).

Generate complete SQL with table creation, RLS, policies, indexes, and permissions.
