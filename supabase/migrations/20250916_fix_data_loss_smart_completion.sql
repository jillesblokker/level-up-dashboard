-- ==========================================
-- FIX DATA LOSS IN SMART QUEST COMPLETION
-- Date: 2025-09-16
-- Purpose: Prevent deletion of historical completion data during daily resets
-- ==========================================

-- The current smart_quest_completion function deletes records when p_completed = false
-- This causes data loss during daily resets. We need to preserve historical data.

-- 1. Create a new version that preserves historical data
