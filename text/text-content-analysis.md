## **Key Areas for Text Review**

### **1. Medieval/Fantasy Theme Consistency**
- Many pages use modern language that could be more thematic
- Consider replacing "Settings" with "Realm Configuration"
- "Profile" could be "Character Scroll"
- "Notifications" could be "Kingdom Messages"

### **2. Toast Messages (Already Improved)**
- ‚úÖ Realm page toast messages have been updated with medieval theme
- Consider applying similar improvements to other pages

### **3. Button Text**
- Many buttons use generic text like "Save Changes", "Cancel", "Delete"
- Could be more thematic: "Seal the Scroll", "Abandon Quest", "Banish Item"

### **4. Error Messages**
- Current error messages are technical and not user-friendly
- Could be more thematic: "The realm's magic has failed" instead of "Network error"

### **5. Loading States**
- "Loading..." could be "Consulting the ancient scrolls..."
- "Saving..." could be "Inscribing to the realm's records..."

### **6. Empty States**
- Some empty states are good (like notifications page)
- Others could be more engaging and thematic

### **7. Form Labels**
- Technical labels like "Display Name" could be "Realm Name"
- "Email Address" could be "Scroll Delivery Address"

This analysis provides a comprehensive view of all text content that could benefit from theming improvements to create a more cohesive medieval/fantasy experience.
