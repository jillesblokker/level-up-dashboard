I have a quest_favorites table that's causing errors. The error is:

"invalid input syntax for type uuid: 'user_2z5XXhrBfLdbU0P6AUCBco0CJWC'"

The issue is that my table was created with user_id as UUID, but I'm using Clerk authentication which provides user IDs as TEXT strings.

Please provide SQL to:
1. Drop the existing quest_favorites table
2. Recreate it with user_id as TEXT (not UUID)
3. Enable RLS with proper policy using auth.uid()
4. Add indexes for performance
5. Grant proper permissions

The table should have: id (UUID), user_id (TEXT), quest_id (TEXT), favorited_at, created_at, updated_at, and unique constraint on (user_id, quest_id).
