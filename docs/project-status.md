## Project Status and QA Report

This document summarizes the current state of the app based on recent fixes, your requirements, and the latest runtime/log observations. It covers what works, what needs improvement, and concrete next steps to reach a reliable, fun habit-building experience with kingdom/realm gamification.

### High-level overview

- The core loop works end-to-end:
  - Clerks’s auth is enforced server-side and used client-side for API calls
  - Completing a quest writes `quest_completion`, applies default rewards to `character_stats`, and updates the “Gains” graphs
  - Inventory fetches/equip/sell flows are authenticated and return data
  - Kingdom graphs render, subscribe to realtime changes, and no longer fail due to missing auth tokens
  - Rank/title evolution modal is persisted and only shows once per milestone level

- Focus areas remaining:
  - Consolidate/standardize token usage for all client API calls
  - Remove the last verbose diagnostics in server routes once you confirm stability
  - Optional: extend “time period” support (year/all) so it matches the API capabilities

---

### Authentication and data access

- Server-side:
  - `lib/supabase/server-client.ts`: uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for secure server-only access
  - Most API routes use Clerk auth validation (either via `getAuth` or the reusable helpers in `lib/supabase/jwt-verification.ts`)

- Client-side:
  - `useAuth().getToken()` is used for requests to protected endpoints (e.g., `components/kingdom-stats-graph.tsx`)
  - `lib/hooks/useSupabase.ts` creates a singleton client with the Clerk token (template: `supabase`) for realtime channels and client reads

Status: working consistently after fixes. Recommendation: keep using the Authorization header for all client → API fetches (we added it to `/api/kingdom-grid` saves).

---

### Data model alignment (Supabase)

- Quests: `quest_completion` (not `checked_quests`) with fields `quest_id`, `completed`, `completed_at`, `xp_earned`, `gold_earned`
- Challenges: `challenge_completion` with `completed`, `date`; rewards come from `challenges` table
- Milestones: `milestone_completion` with `completed`, `date`; rewards come from `milestones` table
- Character stats: `character_stats` aggregates gold/experience/level

Status: aligned across API routes and graphs. CSV export fixed to use actual columns. Daily reset updates the correct tables.

---

### Realtime and syncing

- Hook: `hooks/useSupabaseRealtimeSync.ts` subscribes to changes by table and filters by `user_id`
- Used in: `components/kingdom-stats-graph.tsx`, `app/inventory/page.tsx`, `components/kingdom-grid.tsx` (and timers)

Status: working. Recommendation: keep channel names consistent and ensure user_id filters remain indexed in Supabase.

### Feature-by-feature status

| Feature | User value | Implementation highlights | Status | Next actions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Item name display | Cleaner UI for items | `getItemDisplayName` in `app/kingdom/kingdom-client.tsx` | Done | None |
| Notifications clear-all | Quick cleanup | Already available in `app/notifications/page.tsx` | Done | None |
| Gold transaction logging | Audit trail + balance correctness | `lib/gold-manager.ts` + `/api/gold-transactions` | Done | Monitor logs for anomalies |
| Quests completion | Tracks habits + rewards | `/api/quests` (POST/PUT), writes `quest_completion`, updates `character_stats` | Done | Consider configurable rewards per quest |
| Daily reset | Fresh start each day | `/api/quests/reset-daily` updates `quest_completion` and `challenge_completion` | Done | Add schedule/cron if needed |
| Streaks | Consistency metric | `/api/streaks` now supports PUT | Done | Add UI visibility/testing |
| Inventory (equipped/stored) | Manage items | `/api/inventory` + realtime | Done | None |
| Kingdom stats (quests/challenges/milestones/gold/xp/level) | Motivation via gains | `components/kingdom-stats-graph.tsx` + `/api/kingdom-stats` | Done | Optional: enable year/all periods in UI |
| Rank/title evolution | Motivation milestone | `hooks/title-evolution-context.tsx` + `components/title-evolution-modal.tsx` | Done | Persisted; only shows once |
| Kingdom grid & timers | Gamified progress | `components/kingdom-grid.tsx`, `components/kingdom-grid-with-timers.tsx`, `/api/kingdom-grid`, `property_timers` | Done | We added Bearer token for save; keep testing |

### Known improvements / backlog

- Standardize token usage in all client fetches
  - Most critical paths are updated; continue migrating any cookie-reliant requests to include `Authorization: Bearer` for consistency

- Reduce remaining verbose logs in server routes
  - After your confirmation, remove debug-only console outputs in: `app/api/streaks-direct/route.ts` and any other noisy endpoints you identify

- Time period consistency
  - UI currently supports week/month; API still supports year/all
  - Option A: re-enable year/all in UI; Option B: simplify API to week/month for clarity

- Data validation and metrics
  - Add lightweight runtime validation or Zod schemas on all POST/PUT routes
  - Add a small health-check route that confirms availability of the critical tables and policy compliance

- QA coverage
  - Add a handful of Playwright tests for: quest completion flow, streak update, inventory fetch, kingdom graphs rendering with data

---

### Verification checklist (quick manual test)

- Sign in, go to Kingdom: graphs render without empty-state if data exists (week/month)
- Complete a quest: 
  - `/api/quests` PUT succeeds
  - `quest_completion` shows new/updated row; `character_stats` increments gold/xp
  - Gains graphs update (realtime or on next fetch)
- Inventory: equipped and stored lists load (200s) and reflect changes
- Kingdom grid: place or save grid → POST to `/api/kingdom-grid` succeeds
- Rank modal: appears only on a new milestone level once; does not re-show on page revisit

---

### Recommendations (short list)

- Keep all client fetches authenticated with Clerk token in the headers
- Enable “year/all” in the graphs UI to match the API or simplify API to week/month
- Remove remaining debug logs once you confirm stability in production
- Add light E2E tests for the core loop (quests → rewards → gains)
- Add monitoring on key API routes (error rates, latencies) for early warning

---

### Current confidence

- Core habit-tracking to gamification loop is operational and resilient after the auth/DB alignment
- Remaining work is polish and consistency: standardize fetch auth, finish log cleanup, and optionally expand graph periods
