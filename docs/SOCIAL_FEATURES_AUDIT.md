## 5. Missing Features (High Priority)

### 5.1 Daily Alliance Ritual ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

**Problem:** No daily habit loop for ally interactions

**Solution:** Implement "Daily Alliance Check-In"
- Visit 3 friends' profiles daily
- Send 1 encouraging message
- Complete 1 shared quest
- Reward: Alliance Streak bonus (XP/Gold multiplier)

**Impact:** Would create consistent daily engagement

---

### 5.2 Alliance Streaks ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Problem:** No streak tracking for social interactions

**Solution:** Track consecutive days of:
- Logging in with active friends
- Sending/completing friend quests
- Comparing stats with allies

**Rewards:**
- 7-day streak: "Loyal Ally" title
- 30-day streak: Special creature
- 100-day streak: Legendary title + gold

---

### 5.3 Cooperative Challenges ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Problem:** All activities are individual, missing team element

**Solution:** "Alliance Raids"

- Shared progress bar
- Bonus rewards for all participants
- Medieval "siege" or "dungeon" theme

---

### 5.4 Alliance Halls (Shared Spaces)

**Problem:** No persistent shared space for friends

**Solution:** Virtual "Guild Hall"
- Shared trophy room for achievements
- Message board for async communication
- Shared quest board
- Customizable decorations

---

### 5.5 Seasonal Events

**Problem:** No time-limited social events

**Solution:** Medieval seasonal festivals
- "Harvest Festival" (autumn) - gifting event
- "Winter Solstice" - cooperative challenges
